Merlin Design Space Exploration Infrastructure
==============================================

Merlin DSE is a highly configurable automation infrastructure to free human
beings from manually tuning Merlin pragmas to achieve high performance.
It leverages a gradient-based search algorithm and performance bottleneck analysis
to quickly identify the high impact pragmas and focuses on them in order to give
users a decent QoR as soon as possible. In addition, the search process done by
the gradient-based search algorithm is easy to reason, so users can easily figure
out where to be further improved accordingly.
